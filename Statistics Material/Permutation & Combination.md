## Permutations 
Let's take an example to understand this concept

If 10 students go to a chocolate factory where they see chcolates like Dairy Milk, Kit Kat, 5 Star, Munch, Perk etc.
Now if we told children to write the 3 chocolate names that they have seen.

5 * 4 * 3
__  __  __

As the children have total 5 chocolates first, then after picking up they will remain with 4, and again after puicking one they will remain with 3
Hence 5 * 4 * 3 = 60 ways to write chocolate names.

such as 
- {Dairy Milk, Kitkat, 5 Star}
- {Kitkat, Dairy Milk, 5 Star}
& so on

**This is called as Permutation as orders matters in permutations**

Formula:- 
npr = n!/(n-r)!
- n = No of objects
- r = no of selections

In our case 5p3 = 5!/(5-3)! = 120/2 = 60

## Combinations
In Combinations the repeat will not occur.
such as 
- {Dairy Milk, Kitkat, 5 Star}
- {Kitkat, Dairy Milk, 5 Star}

The above two cases will considered as one bcoz the order is different but the items are repeated.
Only unique combinations are allowed.

Formula:- 
ncr = n!/r!(n-r)!

In our exa,
5c3 = 5!/3!(5-3)! = 120/3!*2! = 120/12 = 10
