## Statistics

**There are two types of statistics:**

1) Descriptive Statistics :- This consist of organizing and summarising the data.
exa:- EDA
(Bar chart, Pie chart, Boxplot etc.)

2) Inferential Statistics:- This consist of collecting sample data and making conclusions about population data using some experiments
exa:-   In an university of 500 students, we can find the average age of students using the sample of 60 students of the same population i.e. 500 students.

exa:- After the election, media do the Exit poll which is based on population and sample concept. 

(Hypothesis testing like t-test, z-test, F-test etc.)


**Questions that can be asked in Descriptive stats**
1) What is the average age of students in the classroom?
2) Relationship between age & gender

**Questions that can be asked in Inferential stats**
1) Is the average age of the students in the classroom is less than the average age of students in University?



## Sampling Techniques

1) Simple Random Sampling :- Every member of the population (N) has equal chance of getting selected in the sample (n).

Examples :- Exit poll, surveys, lottery


2) Stratified Random Sampling :- Select the clusters or groups as samples from population
    Strata = Layers = clusters = groups

exa:- Gender (Male, Female)
      Education degree (masters, bachelor, phd)
      Exit poll only consider people age > 18 (So first stratified sampling then random sampling)


3) Systematic Random Sampling :- Select every nth person as sample from the population

exa :- A credit card salesman let's suppose they approach every nth person for credit card.


4) Convenience Sampling :- Only those who are interseted in the survey will participate.

exa :- A general survey regarding the data science, in this only those people will participate who has the knowledge or interest regarding data science.

exa :- Job requirements, only those will apply who has interested in that job.

5) Purposive Sampling (Judgmental Sampling) :- Sampling where the researcher descides which members of the target population will be selected.

exa:- The research related to any specific topic or domain, we will select the people who have knowledge about that topic.

6) Cluster Sampling :- We make cluster or group of similar kinds of people and select samples from the particular cluster only.


## Variables

A variable is a property that can take any value

**There are two different types of variables**

**1) Quantitative Variable**:- Measured numerically.
exa:- Age, height, weight

**2) Qualitative Variable**:- Categorical variables which are based on some charecteristics
exa:- Gender, Types of fruits, flowers 


**Further Quantitative variables has two types**
1) Discrete variables :- Which is a whole number and not in decimals.
exa :- No of children, no of bank accounts

2) Continuous Variables :- Which is continuous values (any value)
exa :- Height, weight
