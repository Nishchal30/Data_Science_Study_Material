## **Probability Density Function and probability Mass Function**

### **Probability Density Function (PDF)**

There are two types in the probability distribution function
1) Probability Density Function :- Whenever we have continuous data, then the distribution function for that data is called as Probability Density Function.

exa:- Age, Height, Weight

This is basically used when we have to find out the area under the curve at specific point.
exa:- In the class find out the students whose height > 155cm.
p(x > 155cm)


### **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**

1) Probability Mass Function :- Whenever we have discrete data, then the distribution function for that data is called as Probability Mass Function.

exa:- No of bank account, rolling a dice

In this we have a histogram in which the bins are not consistent, we have gaps in between the bins and when we smoothen the curve we get the PMF. Hence the probability value for each random x there is fixed value.

In a dice rolling, the probability for each x = [1,2,3,4,5,6] there is constant probability i.e. 1/6

This is also used when we have to find out the area under the curve at specific point.
exa:- Find out the probabilty for coming less than 4 on a dice.

p(x <= 4) = p(x = 1) + p(x = 2) + p(x = 3) + p(x = 4)
p(x <= 4) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6
p(x <= 4) = 2/3


### **Cummulative Distribution Function (CDF)**

Cummulative means the sum, Hence CDF will be the sum of previous probabilities before that point.

In a dice rolling if we want to find CDF of p(x <= 2)
then it would be
